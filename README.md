# CS50P
**My codes for [CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022) course by Harvard**  \
This is my first ever course and attempt at programming.  
[My Final Project](https://github.com/potat0o/CS50P/tree/637d367419597186a85069f99aa9db466c92c4bb/CS50P/project)

## Week 0 - Created my first **"Hello World"**
 Had minor issues other than the **def** function where its syntax and application took some time to process.
### Things I learnt
- General Syntax of Python
- Formatting of Strings
- Types of variables (int, float..)
- Definition of functions

## Week 1 - Conditioning the Mind
Not much issues as Python's way of coding is not very cryptic and reads like a sentence.
### Things I learnt
- If / Elif / Else Statements
- And / Or

## Week 2 - Loop the Loops
Had no issues with Loops and Lists but was rather confused by Dictionaries especially the indexing of a dict.
### Things I learnt
- While Loops
- For Loops
- Lists and Dicts

## Week 3 - Error 404
Pretty straight forward segment to catch errors that might pop up.
### Things I learnt
- Types of errors
- Try and Except


## Week 4 - Libraries
Was pretty amazed at how easily libraries can be implemented and used. One just has to read a library's documentation to gain access to a large variety of functions.
### Things I learnt
- Using various libraries
- Command Line Arguments
- Packages
- APIs

## Week 5 - Testing it Out
As someone who previously manually "hard" tested my codes, I found this to be pretty helpful especially when dealing with a large number of test cases and functions.
### Things I learnt
- Assert
- Usage of [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/)

## Week 6 - Input & Output
Some of the documents were hard to understand thus spent some time struggling with the parameters of the library functions.
### Things I learnt
- Usage of files (open, close)
- Handling of Data with [CSV](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)
- Work with Images with [PIL](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)

## Week 7 - REGEX
Really enjoyed this segment. Had fun figuring out the REGEX to use.
### Things I learnt
- Using [Regular Expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

## Week 8  - OOP(s)
One of the segments I struggled with the most, definitely need to revisit in the future. Had a difficult time understanding **Classes** especially the *self* tag.
### Things I learnt
- Classes and Class Methods
- Inheritance
- Overloading

## Week 9 - Project
First project I worked on was a mess to say the least. I did not have a plan and only have a vague mental picture of what I wanted. This was how I ended up getting lost halfway through overwhelmed by my thoughts. I kept thinking of new or important features my project should have mid-way through and my code became very messy. It still is probably very messy and could use more work.
### Things I learnt
- Highly advised to start with a rough outline of the project rather than diving straight in
- Have clear and specific variables so you do not get confused when the number of variables increases
